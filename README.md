This project is a C program that implements a singly linked list with the core operations of insertion, deletion, and traversal. The goal of the work is to create a modular and efficient linked list implementation that clearly demonstrates how dynamic memory allocation and pointer manipulation are used in C programming to build and manage data structures. A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which elements, known as nodes, are connected by pointers, with each node containing data and a pointer to the next node. Unlike arrays, linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations, and this allows efficient insertion and deletion without the need for shifting elements. The program developed here follows a menu driven approach where the user can repeatedly select operations until they choose to exit. The program begins with the definition of a node structure that holds an integer data field and a pointer to the next node. The head pointer is used to keep track of the beginning of the list. For insertion, the program supports adding a new node at the beginning of the list and also at a specific position chosen by the user. The program was developed and executed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a popular code editor created by Microsoft. VS Code is a powerful and lightweight source code editor that supports a wide variety of programming languages, including C and C++. It is available on Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it highly accessible to programmers across platforms. One of the key features of VS Code is its extension system. For C programming, the C/C++ extension by Microsoft enables features like syntax highlighting, code navigation, IntelliSense (auto-completion), and debugging tools. With the help of the integrated terminal, users can easily compile C code using GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any other compiler configured in their system. VS Code also supports version control through Git, allowing developers to track changes in their code efficiently. VS Code is particularly suitable for beginners and intermediate programmers due to its user-friendly interface and robust feature set. It is widely used in academic institutions for teaching programming and software development. When inserting at the beginning, the new node is created, its next pointer is linked to the current head, and the head pointer is updated. When inserting at a position, the program traverses the list to the node just before the required position and then inserts the new node by adjusting pointers appropriately. For deletion, the program allows removing a node from a given position. If the position is zero, meaning the first node, the head pointer is updated to the next node and the removed node is freed from memory. If the position is other than zero, the program traverses the list, keeps track of the previous node, and removes the target node by linking the previous node to the node after the one being deleted, finally freeing memory of the deleted node. The traversal function is used to display all nodes in the list starting from the head. It iterates through each node until it reaches NULL, printing the data values. Error handling is included to ensure that insertion or deletion at invalid positions does not crash the program. The program prints messages such as “Invalid” if the user attempts operations beyond the current list length or on an empty list. The main function provides a continuous loop offering the menu options: insert at position, delete at a specific position, traverse the list, and exit. The switch case structure handles user choices and calls the respective functions. This implementation demonstrates modularity because each operation is encapsulated in its own function, improving readability and maintainability. It is also efficient because it avoids unnecessary shifting of data, unlike arrays. Through this program, the user can understand how memory is dynamically allocated and deallocated with malloc and free, how pointers are manipulated to maintain list integrity, and how linked lists provide flexibility for managing collections of data. The deliverable is a complete and working singly linked list implementation in C that satisfies the instructions to implement insertion, deletion, and traversal operations, and it serves as an educational example for students and beginners in data structures and C programming who want to gain a practical understanding of linked lists.
